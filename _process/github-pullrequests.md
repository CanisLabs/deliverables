## Pull Request Submissions
1. Fork the [Deliverables Repo](https://github.com/trustoverip/deliverables).
2. Each `PR` SHOULD be linked to an `Issue`.


### Pull Request Decisions
1. Standard GitHub processing is used.
  * **`Closed`:** The `PR` was reviewed by the WG but it was decided to close it without merging it.
  * **`Merged`:** The WG agreed to `merge` the `PR`.
