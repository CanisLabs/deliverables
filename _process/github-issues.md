# Issue Management

![lifecycle](../_images/lifecycle.png)

ToIP Deliverables that are not on the brink of changing status are discussed through [Github Issues](https://github.com/trustoverip/deliverables/issues).

We generally use Issues to discuss changes that are controversial, and PRs to propose changes that are vetted. This keeps the PR backlog small and avoids ineffective use of mailing-lists.

## Issue Creation Process

Any community member can open an issue.

1.  Visit the [Github Issues](https://github.com/trustoverip/deliverables/issues) dashboard and select the appropriate button for the type of *Issue* you desire to open.
2. Depending on your selection, you will be presented with an **Issue Template** which will help you clearly communicate the relationship of your contribution to the subject deliverable. Each Issue Template will allow you to specify the **Deliverable Number** in the title. For example, to open an issue on **Deliverable 0025**, an appropriate
title for the issue might be:

    [Spec 0025]: Need better diagram in Reference section

3. When the community feels that it's reasonable to suggest a formal status change for a deliverable, best efforts are made to resolve all open issues against it. Then a PR is
raised against the deliverable's main `README.md`, where the status field in the header is updated. Discussion about the status change typically takes place in the comment
stream for the PR, with issues being reserved for non-status-change topics.
