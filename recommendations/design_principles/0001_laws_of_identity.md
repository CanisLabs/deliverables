## Summary
The **Seven Laws of Identity** were [published by Kim Cameron, Architect of Identity at the Microsoft Corporation](https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf) in 2005. This document serves to recognize this work as a collection of design principles for identity solutions.

## List of Principles

| Principle | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1. User Control and Consent | Digital identity systems must only reveal information identifying a user with the user's consent. |
| 2. Limited Disclosure for Limited Use | The solution which discloses the least identifying information and best limits its use is the most stable, long-term solution.|
| 3. The Law of Fewest Parties | Digital identity systems must limit disclosure of identifying information to parties having a necessary and justifiable place in a given identity relationship. |
| 4. Directed Identity | A universal identity metasystem must support both "omnidirectional" identifiers for use by public entities and "unidirectional" identifiers for private entities, thus facilitating discovery while preventing unnecessary release of correlation handles. |
| 5. Pluralism of Operators and Technologies| A universal identity metasystem must channel and enable the interworking of multiple identity technologies run by multiple identity providers. |
| 6. Human Integration | A unifying identity metasystem must define the human user as a component integrated through protected and unambiguous human-machine communications. |
| 7. Consistent Experience Across Contexts|  A unifying identity metasystem must provide a simple consistent experience while enabling separation of contexts through multiple operators and technologies.|
