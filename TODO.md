# To Do Tasks

The following tasks need to be tackled before PR merge.

1. Read/Review content
2. Update `/code` files to be less RFC specific. Since our deliverable types do not have alot in common. Thus we may want to reduce level of checking.
3. Review tag process
4. Review index generation process.
5. Make a decision on `000-type-templates.md` and where do they go.
    * One generic template?
    * Distinguishing proposal templates (GitHub Forms) FROM template type deliverables
    * Unique template per deliverable type (i.e.: `000-spec-template.md`)
    * Do we place these templates in the `_process` folder, the `templates` folder or other?
    * Update [Contributing Instructions](./_process/contributing.md) based on decision herein.
    * Define template format each deliverable type.
6. Review [CI Process](./.circleci)

7. Remove this file from the repo.
