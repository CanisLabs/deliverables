# To Do Tasks

The following tasks need to be tackled before PR merge.

1. Read/Review content
2. Update `/code` files to be less RFC specific. Since our deliverable types do not have alot in common. Thus we may want to reduce level of checking.
3. Review tag process
4. Review index generation process.
5. Define [Process Guide](../_process/guides) format each deliverable type.
6. Review [CI Process](./.circleci)
7. Remove this file from the repo.

## Initial Submissions

The following are planned initial submissions:

1. Migrating Aries RFC 289 to SPEC 001
2. OCA Specs
3. 

## Other items
1. Open an Issue for the definition of the [adoption matrix](./adoption.md) process.
